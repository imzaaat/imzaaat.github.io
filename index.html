			<p class="aboutMeParagraph">My name is Zaid Abu-Tarboush. I don’t know how to introduce myself, rather how to classify it...
			I’m a third-year electrical engineering student at The Hashemite University. But I’m all about computer science and its applications.
			My passion started when I was five years old. When I broke my first computer trying to learn how it functions. Ever since, I’ve been a tireless seeker of knowledge of that field.</p>

			<p class="aboutMeParagraph">I believe that engineering isn’t just a bunch of courses you take. Engineering, to me, is a way of thinking, it’s a mindset. Engineering is being able to learn what you need to, to get the job done. That’s when I started to believe that I can be a robust innovative person in technology industry without having a degree. Because I have the most blissed skill of all time, the ability to learn.</p>

			<p class="aboutMeParagraph">I expect being an entrepreneur anytime. Being a polymath (it’s a bliss, not a curse) with many interests gives me the ability to have breadth knowledge and deep thoughts from different backgrounds to apply to whatever I’m working on. Another positive side, having an idea what a person does and feels in a specific position makes working with teams easy for me. Because I understand them better. I’m currently working to shape out my career, seemingly in artificial intelligence. Probably merge that with space exploration.</p>

			<p class="aboutMeParagraph" style="padding-bottom: 50px">When I’m not doing anything related to science, you can find me reading, drawing, playing video games, listening to music, or taking a walk.</p>

			I have very high and strict standards when it comes to projects - most my work never sees the light of day. *wipes tear away*

			<div class="projTitle"><a href="https://github.com/ZaidxC/ATTT">Assembly Tic-Tac-Toc</a></div>
			
			<div class="projParagraph">
				<p>Like any other tic-tac-toc game, the only difference it was developed by x86 assembly with the help of various interrupts such as, 10h and 21h.</p>

				<p>This very project has been an outstanding experience for me. It gave me an idea about how hard (and fun, maybe?) it was to develop computer software in the early days of computers. Writing programs with assembly makes you feel overpowered, it gives you infinite amount of power to do whatever you want, literally!</p>

				<p>Aside of the hard debugging process with assembly, I think assembly is my new favorite programming language. I feel like I understand how is everything built, working, and evolving. And on top of that, I can read The Art Of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth, the greatest book on algorithms ever, which examples are written in assembly.</p>
			
				<p>I have made a video to preview this "game." You can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/eSaycpIEdmE">here</a>.</p>

			<div class="projParagraph">
				<p>That's where you are right now! In a world where a toaster or coffee maker can connect to the internet (Internet of Things has progressed), one needs to be present online to connect with others. Having a website has advantages no other social media site has.</p>

				<p>Having little knowledge about web design, this project was a great opportunity to learn. I learned so much the hard way. Probably the lesson that I will never forget is; Design for mobiles first, then other devices. I learned this after I had to rewrite the site from scratch. because it was working on PCs, but not mobiles.</p>

				<p>I could've used content management systems like WordPress or Joomla. But building the site from scratch alone, with my bare hands makes it more valuable for me. This also motivates me to keep it updated. I don't want it to be a random site on the internet which was last updated in 2007.</p>

				<p>Currently, the site is operating on Version 2. You can check out Version 1 <a href="v1/index.html">here</a>.</p>
